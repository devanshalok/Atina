# Atina

**Atina** is a job application enhancement tool designed to help users optimize their resumes according to specific job descriptions (JDs). With Atina, users can upload their resume and a JD, and the tool will guide them in adjusting their resume to better align with the requirements of the job. The project is currently built with React and will soon be enhanced with a backend and AI-based features to automate and further refine the resume optimization process.

## Project Overview

Applying for jobs often requires tailoring resumes to highlight relevant skills, experience, and achievements based on the JD. Atina makes this process easier by providing a streamlined interface where users can directly compare their resume with the JD, making it easy to edit and align content for maximum impact.

### Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: To enable secure storage and advanced processing.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Planned updates will use AI to automatically suggest changes, add missing skills, and highlight keywords that align with the JD.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed for managing dependencies and running the application.
- **React**: The frontend framework for the project interface.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devanshalok/atina.git
   cd atina
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Development Server**:

   In the root directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Using the Application**:

   - **Upload Resume and Job Description**: Users can upload their resumes and JD files in supported formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX).
   - **Edit Resume to Match JD**: The interface displays both documents side-by-side, allowing users to edit the resume directly in the app, making adjustments to align with the JD.
   - **Download Updated Resume**: After editing, users can download the optimized version of their resume.

## Future Plans

1. **Backend Development**:
   - Implement a backend server to handle secure data storage and user authentication.
   - Enable saving user progress and managing multiple resumes.

2. **AI-Based Features**:
   - Integrate natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the JD and provide relevant recommendations.
   - Suggest keywords, skills, and phrasing adjustments based on the JD.
   - Highlight gaps or areas for improvement in the resume compared to the JD requirements.

## Built With
